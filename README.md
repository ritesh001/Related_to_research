# Github repository related to my research work

Welcome to my Github Profile. Here, I keep the collection of few scripts useful for electronic structure calculations and material informatics. I also store many of my own scripts developed for the same applications. They are primarily written in python programming language and bash scipting. The description for the directories are:

i) Available-codes: A few available scripts useful in electronic structure calucaltions (mostly VASP-related).

ii) My-codes: Scripts developed or modified by me. Currently they are completely unorganized. The description for using each of the scripts are mentioned at the top.

iii) Miscellaneous: The scripts contained in this directory are intended for miscellaneous applications. Most of the scripts are written by me.
